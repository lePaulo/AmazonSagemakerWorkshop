# Amazon Sagemaker - AutoML  

In this lab, you will get hands-on with Amazon Sagemaker AutoML. Amazon Sagemaker is a modular, fully managed machine learning service that enables developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy ML models at scale.

In this lab, you have three modules available, You can either choose to run any one module which is most relevant to your learning or run all of them :

    Amazon SageMaker Autopilot – Automatically create high-quality machine learning models with full control and visibility. Learn more about feature.

    Amazon SageMaker Debugger – Debug your machine learning models. Learn more about feature.

    Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor – Fully managed automatic monitoring for your machine learning models. Learn more about feature.

For these modules you will assume the role of a machine learning developer working at a bank. You have been asked to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will enroll for a certificate of deposit (CD). The model will be trained on the marketing dataset that contains information on customer demographics, responses to marketing events, and external factors.

The data has been labeled for your convenience and a column in the dataset identifies whether, the customer is enrolled in for a product offered by the bank. A version of this dataset is publicly available from the ML repository curated by the University of California, Irvine. This tutorial implements a supervised machine learning model since the data is labeled, where unsupervised learning models are used when the dataset is not labeled.
