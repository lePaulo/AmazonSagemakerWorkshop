## Lab 2

**Feature Engineering, Training (using your own scikit-learn scripts), Deployment, Inferention**

In this lab we will learn how to use our own Scikit-learn scripts with Amazon Sagemaker. Scikit-learn is a very popular Python machine learning framework. Scikit-learn is very popular becouse of its well-designed API and number of different algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and data/feature pre-processing as well.

In this lab, you will assume the role of a machine learning developer. Your task is to classify different types of irises . You will use notebook `Scikit-learn Estimator Example With Batch Transform.ipynb` that describes how to use machine learning (ML) for the automated classification of irises (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica). The main different between ***lab 2*** and ***lab 1*** is that here you will bring your own Scikit-learn scripts and Amazon Sagemaker will provide pre-built container with the framework image.
