*Feature Engineering, Training (using built in algorithm - XGBoost), Deployment, Inferention*

In this lab, you will learn how to use Amazon SageMaker to build, train, and deploy a machine learning (ML) model. We will use the popular XGBoost ML algorithm for this exercise. Amazon SageMaker is a modular, fully managed machine learning service that enables developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy ML models at scale.

Taking ML models from concept to production is typically complex and time-consuming. You have to manage large amounts of data to train the model, choose the best algorithm for training it, manage the compute capacity while training it, and then deploy the model into a production environment. Amazon SageMaker reduces this complexity by making it much easier to build and deploy ML models. After you choose the right algorithms and frameworks from the wide range of choices available, Amazon SageMaker manages all of the underlying infrastructure to train your model at petabyte scale, and deploy it to production.
