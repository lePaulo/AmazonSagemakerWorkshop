# Amazon Sagemaker Workshop

#### Welcome to Amazon Sagemaker Workshops. Going through this material you will learn how to use [_Amazon SageMaker_](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) to build, train, retraining and deploy a machine learning (ML) model in AWS. We will use Amazon SageMaker Studio - the first fully integrated development environment for machine learning through all exercise. This workshop is divided into 3 following labs:

* [**_Lab 1_**](www.google.com) - Feature Engineering, Training (using built in algorithm - XGBoost), Deployment, Inferention
* [**_Lab 2_**](www.google.com) - Feature Engineering, Training (using your own scikit-learn scripts), Deployment, Inferention
* [**_Lab 3_**](www.google.com) - Auto ML on Amazon Sagemaker

# Prerequisite
Create an S3 bucket in the same region as your Amazon SageMaker studio. Follow the link for detailed steps if required (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-bucket.html). This bucket is used to store intermediate results computed during SageMaker studio.
